Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to MAKERERE UNIVERSITY AI LAB for curating and providing the "Cassava Leaf Disease Classification" dataset on Kaggle. 
This dataset has been invaluable to our research and project, enabling us to develop and test our machine learning models for cassava disease detection. 
We acknowledge the efforts of MAKERERE UNIVERSITY AI LAB in collecting and annotating the dataset, as well as their contributions to advancing research in agricultural technology and artificial intelligence. 
We also extend our appreciation to the Kaggle community for their support and contributions to the dataset. This work would not have been possible without their efforts.
