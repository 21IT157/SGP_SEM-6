# Leaf Diseases Detection using Deep Learning
This repository contains code for detecting diseases in Cassava leaves using Deep Learning techniques, particularly focusing on Vision Transformer Model.



## Overview
Cassava is one of the most important food crops in the world, providing a significant source of calories for millions of people. However, it is susceptible to various diseases that can significantly reduce crop yields. Early detection of these diseases is crucial for effective management and prevention of yield losses.
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based system for automated detection of diseases in Cassava leaves. We utilize the state-of-the-art Vision Transformer Model, which has shown remarkable performance on various computer vision tasks.



## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of high-resolution images of Cassava leaves affected by different diseases, along with healthy leaves for comparison. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle : Link for the Dataset  https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cassava-leaf-disease-classification/data.



## Model Architecture
We employ a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for disease detection. Vision Transformers have gained attention in the computer vision community for their ability to handle large-scale image datasets efficiently while achieving state-of-the-art performance.
