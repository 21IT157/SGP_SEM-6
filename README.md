# Cassava Disease Detection with Deep Learning

## Description
This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques, specifically the Vision Transformer (ViT) model, for automated detection of cassava leaf diseases. Cassava is a vital food crop in many regions, but its production is threatened by diseases such as cassava mosaic disease (CMD), cassava bacterial blight (CBB), cassava anthracnose disease (CAD), and cassava brown streak disease (CBSD). By utilizing deep learning algorithms and a dataset of cassava leaf images, this project seeks to develop an accurate and scalable solution for early disease detection in cassava plants.
