# Mango Leaf Disease Detection

## Introduction

In agriculture, leaf diseases pose a significant threat to crop yield and quality. Mango trees, a staple fruit crop in many regions, are susceptible to various leaf diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses. These diseases can lead to substantial economic losses for farmers and negatively impact food security.

Traditional methods of disease detection in mango trees rely on manual inspection by agricultural experts. However, this process is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often subjective, leading to inaccuracies and delayed responses to disease outbreaks.

To address these challenges, this project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques for the automated detection of leaf diseases in mango trees. By training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on large datasets of diseased and healthy mango leaves, the model can accurately identify and classify different types of leaf diseases with high precision.

## Key Features

- Automated detection of mango leaf diseases using deep learning models.
- Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification.
- Enables rapid and accurate diagnosis of leaf diseases, aiding farmers in timely intervention and crop management.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing leaf images.

## How Deep Learning Overcomes Traditional Techniques

- **Accuracy**: Deep learning models can achieve high levels of accuracy in disease detection, outperforming traditional methods.
- **Speed**: Automated detection using deep learning is significantly faster than manual inspection, allowing for timely responses to disease outbreaks.
- **Scalability**: Deep learning models can be scaled to handle large volumes of data, making them suitable for analyzing extensive datasets of leaf images.
- **Consistency**: Unlike human inspectors, deep learning models provide consistent results, reducing variability and improving reliability in disease diagnosis.
